      <h2>Personal Details</h2>

  <div class="text_box">



        <p>I come to you now having had a career in the construction industry and with a strong interest in photography.

        <p>The environment, nature, landscapes, historical motor sport and steam railways provide me with the basis for most of my photography subjects. If it is there, the challenge is to photograph it.</p>

        <p>I enjoy the fact that I live in a rural setting and I am now increasing my involvement in the local community</p>
